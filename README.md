# CycleGAN-Adding-Snow-AND-Stylizing-Cars-With-Interesting-Paints
This repository is originally from https://github.com/LynnHo/CycleGAN-Tensorflow-PyTorch-Simple and modified to fit the datasets we collected.

It contains two datasets, regular2snow and cars2race_cars.

In regular2snow, the goal is to learn a mapping from regular images without snow to images with snow.

In cars2race_cars, the goal is to learn a mapping from images of regular cars to images of race cars.

See generated_image_samples for trained results! There is still room for improvement. Will keep working on this!
